          <p class="lead">One fateful day in August 2011, Dayna came across a Craigslist ad for an open room in San Francisco. She didn't get the spot for the roommate, but she got Matt's attention...</p>
          <p>Matt knew he was hooked when, at the EA Christmas party a few months later, Dayna busted out dance moves that put his own to shame. Her grace and goofiness, athleticism and attitude, passion and love, thoughtfullness and faith all melded together to create the most beautiful woman he ever met.</p>
          <p>Dayna knew that Matt was the one when Dayna took a nasty spill during an icy day of snowboarding and she wanted nobody else but Matt to take care of her. Matt then ran around the village in search of candy, beers and advil to make the stay in the doctor's office more enjoyable. Dayna fell for his amazing charm, love for life's adventures, passion, faith, silliness and family values. He was the man she had been praying for since she was a little girl.</p>
          <p>Matt sealed the deal while on a romantic wine-tasting trip in Napa. Little did Dayna know, Matt planned for both of their immediate families and closest friends to be at the next winery. Photos of their engagement day can be found <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10100930033811583.1073741841.209362&type=1&l=039a75ad19" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

        <p>Ronnie is Matt's brother and is a Best Man.</p>
        <p>Ronnie and my relationship has been categorized by comptetition ever since I can remember. SATs, college admissions, weightlifting, baseball, GMATs...you name it. But as we compete we lift eachother higher and guide one another along the way.</p>
        <p>I am especially greatful for the advice and mentorship that Ronnie has given me throughout my life, especially in the absence of our Dad. He paved the way for me in high school, gave me an in with his friends (who coined the term "Little Cano") and, most importantly, inadvertently caused my parents to be more lenient with rules and curfews.</p>
        <p>As we grew up, the four-year age gap became less and less. In recent times, we have traveled around the world together, gave eachother job and girlfriend advice and we legitimately enjoy hanging out with eachother. Heck, I even got him a job!</p>
        <p>Simply put, a guy couldn't ask for a better big brother.</p>

        <p>Garrett is Matt's brother and is a Best Man.</p>
        <p>I remember when I took a social psychology class in undergrad and we talked about how typical family dynamics lead to the middle child striking his own path. It explained a lot. Garrett truly has done that and in the best way possible. He follows his heart and is an independent thinker. In his mind, things can and should be amazing. Status-quo should never just be accepted. He is a romantic in many senses of the word.</p>
        <p>Now independent thinkers aren't always the easiest to grow up with, especially when they're only 16-months older than you. He was less of a big brother and more of a friend that was always there for me, no matter what. I know that I can confide anything in Garrett and always count on him for meaningful input. He was my go-to guy for everything related to the proposal.</p>
        <p>As we grew older, we grew closer and Garrett has become my best friend.</p>

        <p>Brad and I have become great friends in spite of Brad being a hardcore Giants fan. Up until recently, Brad always looked forward to that inevitable moment every season when the Dodger's season ended, the Giants continued and Brad could rub it in my face. Still waiting in vain for the moment that ditch the Dodgers for the Giants, Brad relishes the small victories of getting me to go to Giants Spring Training and catching me celebrate (a little) the Giants winning two World Series Championships in the last four years.</p>
        <p>Brad and I have known eachother since freshman year of college and lived together at two different appartments in San Francisco (including 36 Prado). Brad's the kind of guy who always has your back and he certainly has always had mine. I'm honored that he'll have my back as I stand on that altar.</p>

We've always connected at a deep level. For example, I'm Mexican and he always wished he was Mexican... In all seriousness, I've never met a guy who challenges himself as hard as Hof.</p>
        <p>I had the honor of doing a GoRuck challenge with him. You really get to see what a person is made of during these challenges, and there were no surprises with this guy. Even with how tough he is, Hofius is one of the nicest guys you will ever meet.  He's been a huge fan of Dayna and I ever since I first told him about her. He even called this in the Summer of 2012, when Dayna and I had only been dating for six months. Now he'll get the backstage pass for the ceremony.</p>

        <p>I love this guy and was honored to help him propose to his fiance Annie Kadavy (another person I love), even though it took a messy web of lies to pull it off. But we pulled off the first, only and probably last time that he surprised Annie. Mission accomplished. Now I've asked him to help me get off to the right start with the woman I love and want to spend the rest of my life with. No surprise to pull off here though.</p>

        <p>I've heard that older brothers can be intimidating when it comes to their little sisters, but I feel very fortunate to have gotten along very well with Mike from the beginning. Maybe he was only nice to me in because he needed a place to pre-party and crash when he was in SF, but I'm OK with that. I'll take any in I can get.</p>
        <p>In all seriousness, he has always treated me like the brother he never had growing up and I am forever grateful for that. Thank you for letting me in to your amazing family. I'm pumped for all of the memories we will have together.</p>

        <p>Sater's one of the few guys in the world who can pull off the "nice guy" thing AND be openly opinionated. It's an amazing talent and makes being friends with him very stress free. One of the more musically inclined of my friends, he has introduced me to tons of new bands and we've seen quite a few of them together in the City and elsewhere, Outside Lands, Treasure Island and Coachella included.</p>
        <p>We've shared tons of adventures together and I look forward to many more in the future. I really hope Dayna doesn't make him cut his hair for the wedding. I think a ponytail will be nice happy medium. Pumped to have this guy next to me at the wedding.</p>

        <p>I knew it was destiny for us to meet when I moved in to our dorm room, freshman year of college, and we talked about picking up on girls with the song Musiq Soulchild "Just Friends." We led eachother through the shenanigans of freshman year, varsity sports, Sigma Chi, dating and everything else around college life. As roomates for 3 of the 4 years of college, we built a bond that could never be broken. I owe my amazing college experience to this guy.</p>
        <p>As one of the happiest guys you will ever meet, Aaron is the eternal optimist. He thrives off of meeting new people and getting them to laugh. Regardless of his level of sobriety, he is always in the zone while on the dance floor. I respect the hell out of this guy and am honored to have him next to me as I marry Dayna.</p>

        <p>Jonathan is my younger cousin and we have been close since the moment he was born. So close that our Mom's used to trade-off breast feeding responsibilities when we were babies (true story).</p>
        <p>We've grown to become great friends over the years. We always met up every time he came up to San Francisco for work. During one of those trips was when I realized that I wanted to officially ask Dayna out. Later that night I took Dayna out to a romantic dinner at Pizza Orgasmica and made it official!</p>

        <p>Nathan was introduced to our group of friends through Kelton about five years ago and he became one of us faster than anyone could ever have imagined. He soon knew more about my friends then I ever knew. Soon we became great friends ourselves.</p>
        <p>Nathan and I lived a few blocks from eachother in San Francisco for almost four years and hit the Marina many times together. Between that and "shredding the gnar" together in Tahoe, we've had some pretty awesome memories. My wedding party would not be complete without this guy standing next to me as I get sent off in to the married life.</p>

          Subject: $1200 2 Bdrs for Rent in 4 Bdr House ($1,100 and $1,300) w/ car Garage (marina/cow hollow)</p>
        <p>We are two recent Stanford grads living in a four bedroom house in the Marina with large common areas, small patio for BBQs, washer and dryer, and 2 car garage.  We tend to be pretty busy with work (consulting and finance), go out occasionally during the week, and fairly consistently on the weekends. We are looking for two <strong>male</strong> roommates (preferably together) who are social, easygoing, and generally clean and respectful.</p>
        <p>Rent does not include utilities or cable/internet. </p>

        Subject: Excellent Roomate</p>
        <p>Hey guys,</p>
        <p>So, I know you said you were looking for two guys to move in but thought I'd reach out to you anyway. I'm a 23 year old girl who recently graduated from Cal Poly SLO. I just got a job in SF and start work soon so am looking for a great place to live in the Marina. Typical weekday nights are probably mellow but I love going to happy hour and watching Giants games and now that the NFL figured it out Monday Night Football games. Weekend nights/days I like to go out and hang out with my friends (I have a bunch of friends living in the Marina). I'm very fun and easy going. If you decide that you can't find a group of two guys to live here I would love to be considered. Here's my facebook link: </p>
        <p>http://www.facebook.com/...</p>
        <p>Thanks!</p>
        <p>Dayna</p>

          Subject: Re: Excellent Roomate!</p>
        <p>Dayna,</p>
        <p>Thanks for getting back to us on the rooms we put up for rent.  Travis and I will be around the house Thursday evening.  Can you swing by some time between 7 and 9?  We'll give you a tour of the place and make sure to have a few cold beers on hand.</p>
        <p>The address is 36 Prado St.  We're the two story house with a small tree on either side of the garage.</p>
        <p>I think there could be a great fit.  Let us know if you can make it and give me a call if you have any trouble finding the place: 310-713-xxxx. Looking forward to meeting you.</p>
        <p>Best,<br>
        Matt</p>
        <p>-------------------</p>
        <p>Dayna didn't get the roommate position then, but now we get to spend the rest of our lives together. I like to think she won out in the end.</p>
        <p>P.S. Her Dad was waiting outside the entire time she was visiting the house...<strong>with a gun</strong>.</p>
